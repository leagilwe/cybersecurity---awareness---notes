Targeted phishing attacks directed at specific individuals or organizations. Attackers often gather personal information about their targets to make their messages more convincing.

### Smishing and Vishing

- **Smishing**: Phishing via SMS messages.
- **Vishing**: Phishing via voice calls (often using VoIP).
