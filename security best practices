# Security Best Practices

## Password Management

- Use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts that support it.
- Do not reuse passwords across different services.

## Email Security

- Be cautious of unsolicited emails, especially those with links or attachments.
- Verify the sender's email address for authenticity.
- Do not provide personal or sensitive information via email.

## Social Media

- Adjust privacy settings to limit public exposure of personal information.
- Be wary of sharing too much personal information that could be used for social engineering.
- Think before you post: once information is online, it can be difficult to remove.

## Device Security

- Keep operating systems and applications updated with the latest security patches.
- Use antivirus software and keep it updated.
- Encrypt sensitive data stored on devices.

## Network Security

- Use a firewall to monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic.
- Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive transactions; use a VPN if necessary.
- Regularly review connected devices and network access.
